    "summary": "Awarded Second Prize for the research project titled 'Leveraging Modern Vision Architectures and Transfer Learning for Medical Image Classification'. The work explores the application of pre-trained deep learning models, such as ResNet, DenseNet, ViT, and ConvNeXt, in medical image classification using transfer learning techniques. By fine-tuning these models on small-scale datasets of CT, MRI, and histopathological images, the study achieved an average accuracy of 97.74% using a simple learning rate scheduling and early stopping strategy—demonstrating the effectiveness and generalizability of modern architectures in healthcare imaging tasks."
