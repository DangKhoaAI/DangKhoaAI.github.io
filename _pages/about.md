**Short Bio** : My name is Khoa, and and I am currently an undergraduate student pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in **Artificial Intelligence** at [**FPT University, Ho Chi Minh Campus**](https://university.fpt.edu.vn/), with a strong focus on the mathematical and algorithmic foundations of machine learning, deep learning, computer vision and machine learning operations (MLOps). My academic interests are grounded in understanding how algorithms work from first principlesâ€”emphasizing theoretical clarity, mathematical rigor, and practical relevance. 

I am currently working under the guidance of [**Dr. Duc Ngoc Minh Dang**](https://dnmduc.github.io/), a respected researcher in the field of artificial intelligence. Under his mentorship, I have been involved in research projects that investigate **hand sign recognition**, **graph-based neural networks**, and advanced learning techniques for **medical image analysis**. 

Research Interests: Machine Learning , Deep Neural Architectures, Computer Vision, Hand Sign Recognition Graph Neural Networks, Model Optimization, MLOps .
